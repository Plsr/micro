# A Consequential Person

I think I met the most consequential person I know yesterday.

She was married with two kids already, relaized she wanted more kids but her husband din't. Also realized she wasn't happy in her marriage. So so got a divorce.

She did not want to rush into finding someone new to get kids, but also didn't have the time to wait, so she decided to get artificial insemination done.

She works in the medical field and didn't like how she was treated in her home country, so she researched where the work conditions were the best in the world. It was Denmark. So she moved there with her two kids.

One can like that or not, but I absolutely admire the agency and how consequential she is.
