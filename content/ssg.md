# Writing a static site generator

I want to have a place where I can write things without feeling they matter. Not that
my personal website matters much in the grand scheme of things, but I try to keep it
as a professional representation of myself. Things that go on there should be at least
of decent quality.

However, this is limiting me as well. I don't write as much as I could and probably should.
I need a place where that can happen.

There are ready places for that, but of course, I will not use them and just focus on the writing,
but build my own static site generator. Like every sane engineer would do.

At least I'm now able to write about it while I work on it and improve it.

This is basically working (even though it is very rough around the edges). Let's get this thing deployed.
