# Watching people play Dark Souls

Dark Souls is probably my favorite game in the world. There are a few stories out there how it helped people with their depression and gave them a new outlook on life and I think this also applies to me.

Recently, I got the strong urge to experience Dark Souls agian, but I don't really have the time to play it (or I don't take the time). So I started watching people play it, because I often have time to watch 10 minutes of video here and there.

I noticed that watching people play gives me a similar feeling to what I had when I first played it. Seeing people react emotionally (in good and bad ways) to it makes me re-feel the feelings I had when playing it the first time.

I whish I could forget the game completely and experience it again for the first time.
