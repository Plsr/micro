    <h1>Watching people play Dark Souls</h1>
<p>Dark Souls is probably my favorite game in the world. There are a few stories out there how it helped people with their depression and gave them a new outlook on life and I think this also applies to me.</p>
<p>Recently, I got the strong urge to experience Dark Souls agian, but I don&#39;t really have the time to play it (or I don&#39;t take the time). So I started watching people play it, because I often have time to watch 10 minutes of video here and there.</p>
<p>I noticed that watching people play gives me a similar feeling to what I had when I first played it. Seeing people react emotionally (in good and bad ways) to it makes me re-feel the feelings I had when playing it the first time.</p>
<p>I whish I could forget the game completely and experience it again for the first time.</p>
