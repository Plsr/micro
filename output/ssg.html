  <h1>Writing a static site generator</h1>
<p>I want to have a place where I can write things without feeling they matter. Not that
my personal website matters much in the grand scheme of things, but I try to keep it
as a professional representation of myself. Things that go on there should be at least
of decent quality.</p>
<p>However, this is limiting me as well. I don&#39;t write as much as I could and probably should.
I need a place where that can happen.</p>
<p>There are ready places for that, but of course, I will not use them and just focus on the writing,
but build my own static site generator. Like every sane engineer would do.</p>
<p>At least I&#39;m now able to write about it while I work on it and improve it.</p>
<p>This is basically working (even though it is very rough around the edges). Let&#39;s get this thing deployed.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2025-05-25</strong>: We now have basic frontmatter support, allowing for adding a <code>date</code> and <code>title</code> to the posts.</p>
